# Uber-RCA

Q: Uber has received some complaints from their customers facing problems related to ride cancellations by the driver and non-availability of cars for a specific route in the city.

The uneven supply-demand gap for cabs from City to Airport and vice-versa is causing a bad effect on customer relationships as well as Uber is losing out on its revenue.

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to tackle the situation.
